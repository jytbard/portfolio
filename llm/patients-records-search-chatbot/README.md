In this project, I developed a chatbot that retrieves patient records from a CSV file stored in an AWS S3 bucket and displays the data. The initial task involved implementing Kafka to stream data from three different sources, after which the files were uploaded to the S3 bucket. Next, the CSV files were processed and transformed on the Databricks platform according to specified requirements, and the processed data was returned to the S3 bucket for the chatbot to access.

It's worth noting that I applied the same models in a real-world project as part of my role as Lead Big Data Architect. However, I made adjustments to safeguard sensitive information and ensure no details of the live project could be deduced.
