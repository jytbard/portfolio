# Jyotirmoy Bardhan's Portfolio

For this project, I created a chatbot capable of querying user-uploaded documents in PDF, DOCX, and TEXT formats stored in a specified directory (AWS S3 bucket in the live version). The chatbot then provides answers to the user's questions. The key libraries and models I used include Langchain, PyPDF, OpenAI, ChromaDB, and docx2txt.

Importantly, I implemented these models in a real-world project during my role as Lead Big Data Architect. However, I made modifications to protect sensitive information, ensuring no details from the live project could be inferred.
