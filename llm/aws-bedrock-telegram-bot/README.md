# Jyotirmoy Bardhan's Portfolio

In this project, I developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) bot for Telegram, integrating AWS services and Bedrock. I designed the bot's features to ensure seamless user interaction while efficiently utilizing AWS tools.

As the Big Data Architect, I implemented these models in a real-world environment, taking extra precautions to safeguard sensitive information. I carefully adapted the models to prevent any data exposure or inference of project specifics.
