# Jyotirmoy Bardhan's Portfolio

In this project, I developed a system that accepts a topic as input and generates a newsletter on the subject. It also displays search results, the most visited URLs, performs similarity searches through the FAISS database, and provides summaries. The tools I used include Serper (Google Search API), FAISS (https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), and Streamlit, along with other libraries.

Notably, I applied these same models in a real-world project during my role as Lead Big Data Architect. However, I made adjustments to ensure no sensitive information is revealed, and no details from the LIVE project can be inferred.
