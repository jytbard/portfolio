# Jyotirmoy Bardhan's Portfolio

In this project, I developed a system that accepts a topic as input and generates an article on the topic. It also displays search results and the most visited URLs using Google Search, performs similarity searches through the FAISS database, and provides summaries. The tools I used include Serper (Google Search API), FAISS (https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), and Streamlit, along with other libraries.

Notably, I applied these same models in a real-world project during my role as Lead Big Data Architect. However, I made adjustments to ensure no sensitive information is revealed, and no details from the LIVE project can be inferred.
