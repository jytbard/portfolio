# Jyotirmoy Bardhan's Portfolio

In this project, I developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that involved the following key elements:

    -  Establishing multiple LLM agents, each linked to separate knowledge bases, while adhering to strict data security protocols.

    - Handling PDF, image, and text extraction from huge volume of files, with scalability to accommodate up to 10GB.

    - Ensuring each agent's knowledge base was distinct, allowing for individualized conversations.

I implemented these models in a real-world setting while leading as the Big Data Architect. To protect sensitive information, I carefully modified the models to prevent exposure and ensure no project details could be inferred.
