# Jyotirmoy Bardhan's Portfolio

In this project, I developed a medical text analysis system using a large dataset of medical texts. I incorporated tools like NLP, LLM, the MED Palm 2 API, Flask, along with other key libraries.

Importantly, I applied these models in a real-world project while serving as the Lead Big Data Architect. However, I carefully modified the models to ensure that no sensitive data was exposed and no details from the live project could be inferred.
