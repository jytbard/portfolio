In this project, I created a platform that processes an image containing vegetables, identifies them, and recommends a recipe that can be prepared using those vegetables. Additionally, it incorporates a Text to Speech API to pronounce the vegetable names detected in the uploaded image. For the frontend, I utilized Streamlit, while the backend leverages the models facebook/fastspeech2-en-ljspeech and Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large from Hugging Face. 

It's important to mention that I employed these same models in a real-world project during my current role as Lead Big Data Architect. However, I made modifications to ensure no sensitive information is exposed, and no details of the LIVE project can be inferred.
