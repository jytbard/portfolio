In this project, I created a platform that processes invoice PDF files, extracting key information such as Invoice ID, description, issue date, unit price, total amount, bill recipient, sender details, and terms & conditions. The extracted data is then made available for download as a CSV file. This platform was designed to facilitate the migration of handwritten invoice copies into a new system the client was transitioning to. Core libraries I used were OpenAI, PdfReader and Streamlit.

Importantly, I implemented similar models in a real-world project as Lead Big Data Architect, while ensuring adjustments were made to prevent the exposure of sensitive information or any inference of LIVE project details.
