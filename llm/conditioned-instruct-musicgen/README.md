In this project, I developed a platform that seamlessly incorporates vocal-conditioned music generation into the MusicGen framework, ensuring optimal performance and compatibility with a vast dataset of over 200,000 vocal audio files. Leveraging the Parler-tts transformer model from Hugging Face and key libraries like PyTorch, librosa, and soundfile, I achieved this integration.

As the Lead Big Data Architect, I implemented these models in a real-world context, carefully fine-tuning them to safeguard sensitive information and protect crucial details from being exposed in the live environment.
