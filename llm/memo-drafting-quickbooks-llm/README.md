# Jyotirmoy Bardhan's Portfolio

In this project, I integrated external APIs, established a cloud-based database, and leveraged large language models (LLMs) to automate the drafting of investment memos. Key tasks included extracting and formatting financial data (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) for analysis, configuring a scalable AWS RDS database for secure and efficient data storage, and automating the memo creation process with OpenAI, allowing for customizable formatting, tone, and content.

Importantly, I applied these models in a real-world scenario during my role as Lead Big Data Architect, while ensuring adjustments were made to prevent any exposure of sensitive information or details that could be traced back to the live project.
