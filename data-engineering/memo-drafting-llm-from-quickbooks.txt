The project's objective was to integrate external APIs, establish a cloud database, and implement automated functionality using large language models (LLMs) to streamline the drafting of investment memos.

Roles & Responsibilities:

    1. QuickBooks API Integration

    Extracting real-time financial statement data (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) via the QuickBooks API, parsing and formatting it into clean, tabular formats for analysis. This ensures the data is ready for calculations and reporting by other platform functionalities.

    2. Cloud Database Creation and Integration

    Developing a scalable cloud database to store all processed data, connecting and configuring an AWS RDS database to the platform to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval. The database is optimized for handling large datasets, with secure access controls and encryption to safeguard the integrity of financial data.

    3. Large Language Model (LLM) Integration

    Incorporating OpenAI into the platform to automate the generation of investment memos in PDF or Word format. The system allows customization of the memos, enabling users to adjust the tone, structure, and include or exclude specific metrics or analysis points.
