# Jyotirmoy Bardhan's Portfolio

This repository includes script snippets from my LIVE data engineering and data science projects completed while working as a Data Architect and Data Engineer in 3 companies. While it's not feasible to share the entire code for any LIVE projects in public repositories, Iâ€™m providing these samples to demonstrate my programming style and standards to potential employers or companies. Feel free to use the code without attribution, but please note that I offer no guarantees or liability in any form, for its use.

Thank you
